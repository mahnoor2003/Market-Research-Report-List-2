<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monofocal IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aspheric Monofocal IOLs</li><li>Spheric Monofocal IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Monofocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) are a type of implant used during cataract surgery to replace the cloudy natural lens. Aspheric monofocal IOLs are designed to correct spherical aberrations, providing sharper vision and improved contrast sensitivity. They mimic the natural shape of the cornea, minimizing visual distortions. Spheric monofocal IOLs have a uniform curvature and focus only on providing clear vision at a single distance, usually for distance vision. Both types are widely used in the market to improve visual acuity and overall quality of life for cataract surgery patients.</p></p>
