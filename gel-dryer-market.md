<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gel Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Evaporation (Air-Drying) Systems</li><li>Vacuum Drying Systems</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Gel Dryer Market consists of two main types of drying systems: Passive Evaporation (Air-Drying) Systems and Vacuum Drying Systems. Passive Evaporation Systems use ambient air and heat to naturally evaporate liquid from gels. They are cost-effective but require longer drying times. On the other hand, Vacuum Drying Systems create a vacuum environment to decrease the boiling point of liquids, accelerating the drying process. Although they are more expensive, vacuum dryers offer faster and more efficient drying capabilities, making them suitable for industries with time-sensitive operations.</p></p>
