<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Cardiac Pacemakers</li><li>External Cardiac Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pacemakers are medical devices used to regulate the heart's rhythm. Implantable cardiac pacemakers are surgically implanted into the chest to deliver electrical signals to the heart, ensuring a regular heartbeat. They are primarily used for long-term treatment. On the other hand, external cardiac pacemakers are temporary devices that are placed outside the body during emergencies or short-term treatments. They are attached to the skin and deliver electrical signals through electrodes, providing short-term support until a permanent solution is found.</p></p>
