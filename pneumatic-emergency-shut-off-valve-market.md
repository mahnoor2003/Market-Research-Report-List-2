<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Emergency Shut-off Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Closed Type</li><li>Normally Open Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pneumatic Emergency Shut-off Valve market includes two main types: Normally Closed Type and Normally Open Type. In the Normally Closed Type, the valve remains closed in its default state, and pneumatic pressure is required to open it during regular operation. This type is ideal for emergency situations where the valve needs to quickly shut off to prevent further harm or damage. In contrast, the Normally Open Type valve remains open by default, and pneumatic pressure is needed to close it during its normal operation. This type is suitable for applications where shut-off is required to stop the flow of fluids or gases.</p></p>
