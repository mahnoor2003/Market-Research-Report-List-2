<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Apheresis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugation</li><li>Membrane Filtration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Apheresis is a medical procedure for extracorporeal blood purification that involves separating blood components based on size and molecular weight. There are two main types of Apheresis: centrifugation and membrane filtration. Centrifugation involves rapidly spinning the blood in a centrifuge machine to separate components based on their density and sedimentation rate. Membrane filtration, on the other hand, uses a semi-permeable membrane that allows specific molecules to pass through while retaining others. Both methods have applications in therapeutic treatments, such as removing harmful substances from the blood or collecting specific blood components for donation or transplantation.</p></p>
