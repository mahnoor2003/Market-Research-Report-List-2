<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Deicing Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-propelled</li><li>Towed</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Aircraft deicing vehicles are used to remove ice, snow, and frost from the aircraft surfaces. There are two main types: self-propelled and towed. Self-propelled deicing vehicles have their own source of propulsion, allowing them to move independently around the airport. They are usually equipped with a boom or spray system to distribute deicing fluid. Towed deicing vehicles, on the other hand, rely on a tow vehicle to transport them to the aircraft. These vehicles are typically smaller and lighter than self-propelled ones and may have a smaller deicing capacity.</p></p>
