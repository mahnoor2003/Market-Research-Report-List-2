<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cold Planers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wheeled Cold Planers</li><li>Tracked Cold Planers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cold planers, also known as asphalt milling machines, are used in the construction industry to remove the top layer of asphalt or concrete surfaces. There are two main types of cold planers in the market: wheeled cold planers and tracked cold planers. Wheeled cold planers are equipped with wheels, making them more mobile and suitable for smaller projects and urban areas. Tracked cold planers, on the other hand, use tracks for greater stability and are preferred for larger projects and rough terrains where maneuverability is crucial. Both types serve the purpose of efficiently and precisely leveling road surfaces.</p></p>
