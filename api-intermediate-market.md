<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The API Intermediate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Patent Intermediates</li><li>Non-patent Intermediates</li></ul></p>
<p><p>API Intermediate Market Types refer to the different categories of intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry. Patent Intermediates are API compounds protected by patents, exclusively produced by the patent holder. Non-patent Intermediates are compounds that do not have patent protection and can be produced by any manufacturer. Both types play a crucial role in the development and production of pharmaceutical products, but patent intermediates offer market exclusivity and potentially higher profits for the patent holder. Non-patent intermediates, on the other hand, promote competition and may lead to cost savings for the industry.</p></p>
