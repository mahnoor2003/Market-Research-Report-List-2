<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Open Die Forging Presses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Push-Down Forging Presses</li><li>Pull-Down Type Forging Presses</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Open die forging presses are classified into various types based on their operation mechanism. Push-down forging presses work by applying downward force on the workpiece, compressing and shaping it between the upper and lower dies. Pull-down type forging presses, on the other hand, operate by pulling the upper die down towards the lower die, exerting pressure on the workpiece. Additionally, there are other types of forging presses that employ different mechanisms for shaping the workpiece. These classifications help in selecting the appropriate forging press based on the specific requirements of the forging process.</p></p>
