<p><h1>Human Thrombin Market Size: Global Industry Overview, Market Segmentation and Forecast (2024 to 2031)</h1></p><p><strong>Human Thrombin Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Human thrombin is a naturally occurring enzyme that plays a crucial role in the body's blood clotting process. It is produced by the conversion of prothrombin, a precursor protein, into its active form in response to injury or bleeding. Human thrombin is mainly used in medical settings as a drug or surgical aid, particularly in situations where quick and efficient blood clotting is necessary.</p><p>The global human thrombin market is witnessing significant growth due to several factors. Firstly, an increasing prevalence of surgical procedures worldwide has led to a higher demand for hemostatic agents like human thrombin. Additionally, advancements in healthcare infrastructure and rising investments in research and development are driving market growth. The market is also benefiting from the growing adoption of minimally invasive surgical techniques, which often require efficient hemostasis.</p><p>Moreover, the rising geriatric population and the subsequent increase in age-related health issues contribute to the growth of the human thrombin market. Elderly individuals commonly experience conditions that require surgical interventions, making human thrombin an essential component for their treatment.</p><p>In terms of market trends, there is a growing preference for human thrombin derived from a human recombinant source rather than bovine-derived thrombin. This preference is primarily due to concerns over potential side effects associated with bovine-derived thrombin, such as antibody formation and an increased risk of thromboembolic events.</p><p>In conclusion, the human thrombin market is expected to experience significant growth in the coming years, with an estimated CAGR of 10.6% during the forecast period. Factors driving this growth include the increasing number of surgical procedures, advancements in healthcare infrastructure, and the preference for human recombinant thrombin.</p></p>
