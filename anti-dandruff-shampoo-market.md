<p><strong>The Anti-dandruff Shampoo Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Silicone</li><li>Silicone-free</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The anti-dandruff shampoo market can be categorized into two main types: silicone and silicone-free. Silicone-based shampoos contain ingredients like dimethicone or cyclomethicone, which coat the hair shaft to provide a smooth and glossy appearance. These shampoos are popular because they offer effective dandruff control while also improving hair texture. On the other hand, silicone-free shampoos do not contain silicone derivatives and are preferred by individuals who avoid such ingredients due to concerns like product build-up or environmental impact. These shampoos provide dandruff control without the use of silicone.</p></p>
