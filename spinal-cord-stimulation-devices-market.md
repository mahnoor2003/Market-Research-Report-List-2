<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Cord Stimulation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rechargeable SCS</li><li>Non-Rechargeable SCS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal cord stimulation devices market consists of two types: rechargeable SCS and non-rechargeable SCS. Rechargeable SCS devices are powered by a rechargeable battery that can be recharged when it runs out of power. These devices are more cost-effective in the long run as they do not require frequent battery replacement. On the other hand, non-rechargeable SCS devices use a non-rechargeable battery that needs to be replaced once it is depleted. Although they may require more battery replacements, these devices are generally more affordable upfront.</p></p>
