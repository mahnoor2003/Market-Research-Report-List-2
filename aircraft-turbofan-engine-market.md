<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Turbofan Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Bypass Type</li><li>Low-Bypass Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Aircraft Turbofan Engine Market can be classified into two types: High-Bypass Type and Low-Bypass Type. </p><p>High-Bypass Type engines have a larger fan diameter, which results in a higher bypass ratio. These engines are more fuel-efficient and quieter compared to Low-Bypass Type engines. They are commonly used in commercial aircraft for long-haul flights, as they provide a higher amount of thrust.</p><p>Low-Bypass Type engines, on the other hand, have a smaller fan diameter and a lower bypass ratio. They are generally used in military aircraft, where a higher thrust-to-weight ratio is required for faster and more maneuverable flights. These engines are less fuel-efficient and louder compared to High-Bypass Type engines.</p></p>
