<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardiac Pacemaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>ICD</li><li>BI-V ICD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable cardiac pacemaker market includes three main types: pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), and biventricular ICDs (BI-V ICDs). Pacemakers use electrical pulses to regulate the heart's rhythm, while ICDs monitor and treat life-threatening arrhythmias through delivering electrical shocks. BI-V ICDs, also known as cardiac resynchronization therapy devices, are used for patients with heart failure and abnormal heart electrical activity. They deliver synchronized electrical pulses to both ventricles to improve heart function. These market segments cater to patients with different cardiac conditions, providing tailored treatment options.</p></p>
