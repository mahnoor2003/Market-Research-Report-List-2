<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Life Support System (ECLS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial)</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Life Support System (ECLS) is a medical device utilized in critical cases to support heart and lung functions. The market is classified into two types: Veno-Arterial (VA) and Veno-Venous (VV). VA ECLS provides both cardiac and respiratory support by removing blood from a vein, oxygenating it, and then returning it to an artery. On the other hand, VV ECLS solely helps with oxygenation by redirecting blood from a vein to an oxygenator and returning it to the same vein, bypassing the lungs.</p></p>
