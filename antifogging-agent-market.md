<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antifogging Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Outside Antifoggant</li><li>Within Antifoggant</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The antifogging agent market can be divided into two main types: outside antifoggants and within antifoggants. Outside antifoggants are substances applied to the outer surface of a material, such as glass or plastic, to prevent fog from forming. They work by reducing the surface tension of the material, allowing the water droplets to spread evenly and not form fog. Within antifoggants, on the other hand, are additives incorporated into the material itself during manufacturing. They work by altering the surface properties of the material to prevent the formation of fog from inside.</p></p>
