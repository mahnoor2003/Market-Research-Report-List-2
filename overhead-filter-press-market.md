<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overhead Filter Press Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Free Flow</li><li>Obscure Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the overhead filter press market, there are two types: free flow and obscure flow. Free flow filter presses allow for unobstructed movement of filtrate, resulting in efficient filtration and maximum productivity. On the other hand, obscure flow filter presses require more complex mechanisms to separate the filtrate, leading to a reduction in productivity. Both types have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on the specific needs and requirements of the application.</p></p>
